        Understand- return the shortest subtring of s such that includes every character in t; including substrings
            if it doesnt exist return empty string
            input- strings s and t
            output- shortest substring of s
        Plan-
        window is valid if it includes the characters in t then we check if the len is the smallest 
        everytime we have a valid window store window size and window then remove leftmost char
